                  Twas brillig, and the slithy toves                  
                   Did gyre and gimble in the wabe.                   

                    All mimsy were the borogoves,                     
                     And the mome raths outgrabe.                     

                    Beware the jabberwock, my son!                    
              The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!               

                   Beware the jubjub bird, and shun                   
                      The frumious bandersnatch!                      

                  He took his vorpal sword in hand:                   
                 Long time the maxome foe he sought-                  

                   So rested he by the tumtum tree,                   
                    And stood a while in thought.                     

                    As in uffish thought he stood,                    
                 The jabberwock, with eyes of flame,                  

               Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,                
                       And burbled as it came.                        

             One, two! one, two! and through and through              
                 The vorpal blade went snicker-snack.                 

                  He left it dead, and with its head                  
                       He went galumphing back.                       

                    Has thou slain the jabberwock?                    
                   Come to my arms, my beamish boy!                   

                   O frabjous day! calloh! callay!                    
                       He chortled in his joy.                        

                  Twas brillig, and the slithy toves                  
                   Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:                   

                    All mimsy were the borogoves,                     
                     And the mome raths outgrabe.
